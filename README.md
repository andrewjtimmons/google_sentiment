None of the data I analyzed is intended to be a definitive and all encompasing list of terms people use to identify themselves.  Some of the below terms may be problematic.  The inclusion of them here doesn't mean I endorse a specific term, nor does omission of a term indicate I oppose that term. My goal was to generate a non exhaustive list of terms that I could use for this project that are used somewhere in the world by someone.
